# Boat port data scraper

Within this repo I have created a program that will scrape data from the UN/LOCODE Code List by Country and Territory website (https://unece.org/trade/uncefact/unlocode).

This contains information about the United Nations code for trade and transport locations. It includes over 103, 034 locations in 249 countries and territories. You can find more information with the link above. Here is the link to the different locations (https://unece.org/trade/cefact/unlocode-code-list-country-and-territory).

The aim of the project was to scrape the data from the website and then process it and save the processed data for future use within a database.

The program will scrape all the data from the website and save as raw data files in csv format. Then it will process the raw data files into cleaned csv files for future use. 

## The data process

This is an example of what the data looked like before processing:
